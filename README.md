# Introduction-to-statistical-learning
This repository contains my personal notes and from my self-study of  "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". 

Main definitions, ideas, and comments from each chapter are included in the notes, but examples are usually skipped. This repository is not intended as a replacement for the book.

Each included chapter has a Jupyter notebook including notes on the chapter and a Jupyter notebook including the coding examples -- notes and solutions using LaTeX in markdown and executable Python.
