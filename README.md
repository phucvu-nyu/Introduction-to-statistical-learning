# Introduction-to-statistical-learning
Welcome to my personal notes and from my self-study of  "An Introduction to Statistical Learning". 
# The book is about common concepts of statistical learning 
generalized linear model, cross validation, Lasso and Ridge regression, and so all
# What we have here?
Main definitions, ideas, and comments from each chapter are included in the notes, but examples are usually skipped. This repository is not intended as a replacement for the book.

Each included chapter has a Jupyter notebook including notes on the chapter and a Jupyter notebook including the coding examples -- notes and solutions using LaTeX in markdown and executable Python.
